I designed a project with an automatic speed breaker system using two ultrasonic sensors. It adjusts the height of speed breakers based on the vehicle's speed. The sensors detect the distance between the vehicle and the speed breaker, allowing for precise height adjustment. This implementation enhances road safety by enabling controlled speed reduction, minimizing the chances of accidents. It's an innovative solution with promising implications for transportation safety.</p>

                I developed a remarkable projectâ€”a WiFi-controlled car with an autonomous parking capability. This innovation allows users to remotely operate the car through a WiFi connection. Additionally, the car's advanced sensors and cameras enable it to identify vacant parking spots and autonomously park itself. This project demonstrates the potential for smart technology to revolutionize transportation and simplify our lives.

                I developed an impressive project: a fully automated parking system with its own website. This system operates by taking the user's vehicle number plate as input on the website. Based on the provided number plate, the system intelligently recommends available parking lots that can accommodate the specific vehicle. This project highlights the power of automation in streamlining the parking process and maximizing parking space utilization.
